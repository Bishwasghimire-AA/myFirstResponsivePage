                Kong Fuzi, commonly Latinized as Confucius, was a Chinese philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period
                who is traditionally considered the paragon of Chinese sages. Confucius's teachings and philosophy
                underpin East Asian culture and society, remaining influential across China and East Asia to this
                day. His philosophical teachings, called Confucianism, emphasized personal and governmental morality,
                correctness of social relationships, justice, kindness, and sincerity.

                Confucius considered himself a transmitter for the values of earlier periods which he claimed had been
                abandoned in his time. His followers competed with many other schools during the Hundred Schools of
                Thought era, only to be suppressed in favor of the Legalists during the Qin dynasty. After the collapse
                of Qin and the victory of Han over Chu, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction in the new
                government. During the Tang and Song dynasties, Confucianism developed into a system known in the West
                as Neo-Confucianism, and later as New Confucianism. Confucianism was part of the Chinese social fabric
                and way of life; to Confucians, everyday life was the arena of religion.Confucius is traditionally
                credited with having authored or edited many of the Chinese classic texts, including all of the Five
                Classics, but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. At
                least some of the texts and philosophy he taught were already ancient. Aphorisms concerning his
                teachings were compiled in the Analects, but only many years after his death.
